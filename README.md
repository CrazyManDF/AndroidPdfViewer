# Android PdfViewer

Library for displaying PDF documents on Android, with `animations`, `gestures`, `zoom` and `double tap` support.
It is based on [PdfiumAndroid](https://github.com/barteksc/PdfiumAndroid) for decoding PDF files. Works on API 11 and higher.
Licensed under Apache License 2.0.

## What's new in 2.1.0?
* fixed loading document from subfolder in assets directory
* fixed scroll handle NPE after document loading error (improvement of 2.0.3 fix)
* fixed incorrect scroll handle position with additional views in RelativeLayout
* improved cache usage and fixed bug with rendering when zooming
* if you are using custom scroll handle: scroll handle implementation changed a little bit, check DefaultScrollHandle source for details

## Changes in 2.0 API
* `Configurator#defaultPage(int)` and `PDFView#jumpTo(int)` now require page index (i.e. starting from 0)
* `OnPageChangeListener#onPageChanged(int, int)` is called with page index (i.e. starting from 0)
* removed scrollbar
* added scroll handle as a replacement for scrollbar, use with `Configurator#scrollHandle()`
* added `OnPageScrollListener` listener due to continuous scroll, register with `Configurator#onPageScroll()`
* default scroll direction is vertical, so `Configurator#swipeVertical()` was changed to `Configurator#swipeHorizontal()`
* removed minimap and mask configuration

## Installation

Add to _build.gradle_:

`compile 'com.github.barteksc:android-pdf-viewer:2.1.0'`

Library is available in jcenter repository, probably it'll be in Maven Central soon.

## Include PDFView in your layout

``` xml
<com.github.barteksc.pdfviewer.PDFView
        android:id="@+id/pdfView"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"/>
```

## Load a PDF file

All available options with default values:
``` java
pdfView.fromUri(Uri)
or
pdfView.fromFile(File)
or
pdfView.fromAsset(String)
    .pages(0, 2, 1, 3, 3, 3) // all pages are displayed by default
    .enableSwipe(true)
    .swipeHorizontal(false)
    .enableDoubletap(true)
    .defaultPage(0)
    .onDraw(onDrawListener)
    .onLoad(onLoadCompleteListener)
    .onPageChange(onPageChangeListener)
    .onPageScroll(onPageScrollListener)
    .onError(onErrorListener)
    .enableAnnotationRendering(false)
    .password(null)
    .scrollHandle(null)
    .load();
```

* `enableSwipe` is optional, it allows you to block changing pages using swipe
* `pages` is optional, it allows you to filter and order the pages of the PDF as you need
* `onDraw` is also optional, and allows you to draw something on a provided canvas, above the current page

## Scroll handle

Scroll handle is replacement for **ScrollBar** from 1.x branch.

From version 2.1.0 putting **PDFView** in **RelativeLayout** to use **ScrollHandle** is not required, you can use any layout.

To use scroll handle just register it using method `Configurator#scrollHandle()`.
This method accepts implementations of **ScrollHandle** interface.

There is default implementation shipped with AndroidPdfViewer, and you can use it with
`.scrollHandle(new DefaultScrollHandle(this))`.
**DefaultScrollHandle** is placed on the right (when scrolling vertically) or on the bottom (when scrolling horizontally).
By using constructor with second argument (`new DefaultScrollHandle(this, true)`), handle can be placed left or top.

You can also create custom scroll handles, just implement **ScrollHandle** interface.
All methods are documented as Javadoc comments on interface [source](https://github.com/barteksc/AndroidPdfViewer/tree/master/android-pdf-viewer/src/main/java/com/github/barteksc/pdfviewer/scroll/ScrollHandle.java).


## Additional options

### Bitmap quality
By default, generated bitmaps are _compressed_ with `RGB_565` format to reduce memory consumption.
Rendering with `ARGB_8888` can be forced by using `pdfView.useBestQuality(true)` method.

### Double tap zooming
There are three zoom levels: min (default 1), mid (default 1.75) and max (default 3). On first double tap,
view is zoomed to mid level, on second to max level, and on third returns to min level.
If you are between mid and max levels, double tapping causes zooming to max and so on.

Zoom levels can be changed using following methods:

``` java
void setMinZoom(float zoom);
void setMidZoom(float zoom);
void setMaxZoom(float zoom);
```

## Possible questions
### Why resulting apk is so big?
Android PdfViewer depends on PdfiumAndroid, which is set of native libraries (almost 16 MB) for many architectures.
Apk must contain all this libraries to run on every device available on market.
Fortunately, Google Play allows us to upload multiple apks, e.g. one per every architecture.
There is good article on automatically splitting your application into multiple apks,
available [here](http://ph0b.com/android-studio-gradle-and-ndk-integration/).
Most important section is _Improving multiple APKs creation and versionCode handling with APK Splits_, but whole article is worth reading.
You only need to do this in your application, no need for forking PdfiumAndroid or so.
